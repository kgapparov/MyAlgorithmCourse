     * Problem 1
     *
     * Show that for any simple graph G (not necessarily connected) having n vertices and m edges, if
     * m â‰¥ n, then G contains a cycle
     *
     * Answer:
     * Suppose G consist from components G0 G1 ... Gk => G(n, m) =>G0(m0 , n0) , Gk (mk, nk) which is connected
     * components, thus
     * to beeing connected we need m0 = n0 - 1 edges,
     * m = n0 -1 + n1 -1 + .. + nk -1 = n - K;
     * k - component counts. to be connected if we have 1 component then we need m = n - 1, adding extra edges m > n will
     * cause cycle
